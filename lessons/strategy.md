# Debate Strategy Lessons

This file contains lessons about debate strategy. Agents should consult these when formulating arguments or organizing evidence.

## Argument Construction

### Every Argument Needs Three Parts
1. **Claim**: What you're arguing
2. **Warrant**: Why it's true (evidence/reasoning)
3. **Impact**: Why it matters

### Link Chains Matter
- Don't assume the judge will connect the dots
- Spell out: A leads to B leads to C leads to impact
- Each link needs its own warrant

## Weighing Arguments

### Magnitude
- How big is the impact?
- Quantify when possible (jobs lost, dollars, lives affected)

### Probability
- How likely is the impact to occur?
- Distinguish between "could happen" and "will happen"

### Timeframe
- When does the impact occur?
- Immediate harms often outweigh distant ones

### Reversibility
- Can the harm be undone?
- Irreversible harms carry more weight

## Answering Arguments

### Types of Answers
1. **No Link**: Their cause doesn't lead to their effect
2. **No Impact**: Even if true, it doesn't matter
3. **Turn**: Their argument actually helps our side
4. **Outweigh**: Even if true, our impacts are bigger

### Don't Just Deny - Explain Why
- BAD: "That's not true"
- GOOD: "That's not true because [specific reason with evidence]"

## Evidence Strategy

### Quality Over Quantity
- One strong card beats three weak ones
- Depth of analysis matters more than number of sources

### Anticipate Opponents
- Research BOTH sides of the resolution
- Know their best arguments so you can answer them
