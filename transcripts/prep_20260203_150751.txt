Good. Now I'll focus on cutting cards across 6 key topics. Let me prioritize:
1. **Human rights abuses** (support)
2. **Nuclear threat** (support)
3. **Terrorism sponsorship** (support)
4. **Military feasibility** (support)
5. **Democratization potential** (support)
6. **Answers to Iraq comparison** (answer)

The challenge of the repressive apparatus could be dealt with through a foreign-supported regime change scenario, where external actors weaken the suppressive infrastructure of the regime. Opponents of this option cite the outcome in Libya as a cautionary example, where foreign intervention, primarily in the form of air strikes, led not only to the collapse of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s regime, but to prolonged civil war and the country\u2019s fragmentation.\n\n3. **The alternative to regime change: Changing the regime\u2019s behavior | Middle East Institute**\n   URL: https://www.mei.edu/publications/alternative-regime-change-changing-regimes-behavior\n   Description: A different future with Iran is possible \u2014 if we try a different approach. ...

A full-scale invasion might eliminate any Iranian nuclear weapons ambitions, but it would be unmatched in scope and consequences since the second world war.
