Agent Thinking:
Excellent. I have my research targets. Now I'll focus on cutting cards across 3 main topics:
1. **Nuclear threat** (Iran's nuclear program justifies intervention)
2. **Human rights abuses** (regime brutally oppresses its people)
3. **Proxy warfare/terrorism** (Iran destabilizes the Middle East)

Let me start researching and cutting cards. I'll prioritize search → fetch → cut workflow.
