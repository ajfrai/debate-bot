Good! I have my research targets. Now I'll focus on cutting cards. Let me prioritize the most strategic arguments:

**Priority research topics:**
1. Iran human rights violations (supporting cards)
2. Iran nuclear threat + proliferation (supporting cards)
3. Iran terrorism sponsorship (supporting cards)
4. Democratic transition feasibility (supporting cards)
5. Iraq/Libya comparison answers (answer cards to CON's likely case)

Let me start by searching for evidence on Iran's human rights violations.
