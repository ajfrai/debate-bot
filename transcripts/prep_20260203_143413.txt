Agent Thinking:
Good! Now I have my research targets. I'll focus on cutting cards across 6 key topics:
1. Iran human rights violations (support)
2. Nuclear threat imminence (support)
3. State sponsor of terrorism (support)
4. Regime change feasibility (support + answers to failure)
5. Diplomatic alternatives fail (support)
6. Answers to civilian casualties/destabilization

Let me start researching and cutting cards. I'll search for sources on Iran's human rights violations first.
