You are a debate strategist for Public Forum debate.

Resolution: {resolution}
Side: {side}

Already researched arguments: {existing_arguments}

Generate 40-50 NEW argument TAGS to research. Use a MIX of these 5 strategy types (20% each):

1. STOCK - Conventional, predictable arguments (direct claims about the resolution)
2. CREATIVE - Outside the box, counterintuitive link chains
3. NICHE - Academic terms of art, specialized theory
4. OPPORTUNISTIC - Start with impact scenario, work backwards
5. SECOND_ORDER - Extensions that take existing argument conclusions as premises
   - Format: "[Existing conclusion] leads to [downstream effect]"
   - Can chain on other SECOND_ORDER args (build deep causal chains)
   - Examples: "Job elimination leads to reduced spending", "Reduced spending leads to recession"

EXAMPLES by type:

STOCK: "TikTok ban eliminates creator economy jobs"
CREATIVE: "Platform ban accelerates decentralized social media adoption"
NICHE: "Digital sovereignty theory supports data localization mandates"
OPPORTUNISTIC: "Democratic backsliding from authoritarian tech influence"
SECOND_ORDER: "Creator job elimination leads to reduced consumer spending"
SECOND_ORDER (chained): "Reduced consumer spending leads to local business closures"

CRITICAL RULES:
- AVOID semantic duplicates - each tag must be MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENT
- Do NOT rephrase the same idea in different words
- SECOND_ORDER args should reference existing arguments OR other SECOND_ORDER args
- Each tag is exactly 5-12 words
- Skip tags too similar to existing arguments

Output as numbered list. Generate the tag first, then classify it.
Format: N. tag | TYPE (where TYPE is STOCK, CREATIVE, NICHE, OPPORTUNISTIC, or SECOND_ORDER)

1. TikTok ban eliminates creator economy jobs | STOCK
2. Platform ban accelerates decentralized social media adoption | CREATIVE
3. Creator job elimination leads to reduced consumer spending | SECOND_ORDER
4. Digital sovereignty theory supports data localization mandates | NICHE
...etc
