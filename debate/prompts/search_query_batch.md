You are generating search queries to find strategic debate evidence. This is NOT mechanical—it requires thinking about what evidence exists, where it lives, and how to find it.

Tasks:
{task_lines}

CORE PRINCIPLE: Most arguments aren't pre-packaged online as "evidence for X." You must search for components, mechanisms, comparisons, and adjacent findings that can support the argument strategically.

QUERY STRATEGIES (generate 3-5 diverse queries per task):

**1. Lay of the Land** - Build foundational understanding
- What background concepts does the argument rely on?
- Example: For "TikTok algorithm breeds addiction" → "how TikTok recommendation system works"
- Think: What do I need to understand before I can argue this effectively?

**2. Source Check** - Has an authoritative institution studied this?
- Target universities, research institutes, major think tanks, expert organizations
- Example: "TikTok addiction" Stanford study | "social media mental health" NIH research
- Think: What institutions would care about this topic?

**3. Known Strong Sources** - Target canonical experts, influential papers, or landmark studies
- Who are the recognized voices in this domain? What are the seminal works?
- Example: "Fearon state capacity civil war" | "Sunstein polarization echo chambers"
- Think: If I asked a professor about this topic, whose work would they mention?

**4. Mechanism Search** - Find evidence for the underlying causal pathway
- Don't just restate the claim—search for HOW or WHY it works
- Example: For "algorithm breeds addiction" → "variable reward schedules dopamine" | "infinite scroll psychological effects"
- Think: What's the mechanism? Can I find evidence for each step in the causal chain?

**5. Opportunistic - Concept Mix** - Link unexpected concepts for unique evidence
- Guess at connections others won't find; mix domains creatively
- Example: "civil war water scarcity" | "TikTok addiction compared to gambling"
- Think: What surprising connections might yield strategic evidence no one else has?

**6. Comparative/Analog Evidence** - Find similar cases or parallels
- If direct evidence is scarce, what analogies or comparisons exist?
- Example: "Instagram addiction rates teen" (for TikTok) | "Yugoslavia ethnic conflict" (for civil war theory)
- Think: What similar phenomena have been studied better?

**7. Quantification Hunt** - Find specific numbers, percentages, or measurements
- Include phrases that appear in empirical findings
- Example: "percent increase smartphone addiction" | "correlation coefficient social media depression"
- Think: What would a study measuring this actually say? What metrics matter?

**8. Expert Opinion/Commentary** - Find analysis from practitioners or thought leaders
- Target op-eds, white papers, expert testimony, industry analysis
- Example: "tech ethicist TikTok design manipulation" | "economist China trade restrictions"
- Think: Who works on this problem professionally? What would they write?

QUERY CRAFT:
- Be concrete: Use specific terms that would appear on relevant pages
- Think about language: Academic papers say "problematic usage patterns"; news says "addiction"
- Target fetchable sources: Studies, articles, reports, white papers (avoid paywalled journals)
- Use quotes strategically for exact phrases
- Include recent years when timeliness matters
- Max 15 words per query

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each task, output 3-5 queries. Use this EXACT format with NO extra text:

Task 1:
- query text here
- query text here
- query text here

Task 2:
- query text here

CRITICAL RULES:
- Start each section with exactly "Task N:" on its own line
- Each query starts with "- " (dash + space)
- ONE query per line
- NO explanations, NO strategy labels, NO extra text
- Max 15 words per query

REMEMBER: Your goal is finding evidence that can be deployed strategically in speeches. Think like a debater, not a search robot.
