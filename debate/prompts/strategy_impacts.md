You are building IMPACT EVIDENCE for debate arguments.

Resolution: {resolution}
Side: {side}

Current arguments: {existing_arguments}

Generate 40-50 IMPACT TAGS using a MIX of these 5 types (20% each):

1. STOCK - Conventional, predictable terminal impacts (war, recession, job loss)
2. CREATIVE - Unexpected, counterintuitive impact cascades
3. NICHE - Impacts grounded in specialized academic theory
4. OPPORTUNISTIC - High-magnitude impact scenarios (extinction, collapse)
5. SECOND_ORDER - Causal chains: "[Effect] leads to [Consequence]"
   - Can chain on other SECOND_ORDER impacts (build deep impact chains)
   - Examples: "Turnout decline leads to gridlock", "Gridlock leads to democratic erosion"

EXAMPLES by type:

STOCK: "Impact: Economic recession ensues"
STOCK: "Impact: Unemployment skyrockets"
CREATIVE: "Impact: Innovation ecosystem collapses"
CREATIVE: "Impact: Institutional trust evaporates"
NICHE: "Impact: Authoritarian diffusion undermines democracies"
NICHE: "Impact: Systemic risk cascades through markets"
OPPORTUNISTIC: "Impact: Great power war erupts"
OPPORTUNISTIC: "Impact: Existential catastrophe risk increases"
SECOND_ORDER: "Impact: Reduced turnout leads to policy gridlock"
SECOND_ORDER: "Impact: Policy gridlock leads to democratic erosion"

CRITICAL RULES:
- AVOID semantic duplicates - each tag must be MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENT
- Do NOT create variants of the same impact
- SECOND_ORDER impacts should build chains (reference existing impacts or other SECOND_ORDER)
- Each tag starts with "Impact:" and is 5-12 words

Output as numbered list. Generate the tag first, then classify it.
Format: N. Impact: tag | TYPE (where TYPE is STOCK, CREATIVE, NICHE, OPPORTUNISTIC, or SECOND_ORDER)

1. Impact: Economic recession ensues | STOCK
2. Impact: Innovation ecosystem collapses | CREATIVE
3. Impact: Reduced turnout leads to policy gridlock | SECOND_ORDER
4. Impact: Authoritarian diffusion undermines democracies | NICHE
...etc
