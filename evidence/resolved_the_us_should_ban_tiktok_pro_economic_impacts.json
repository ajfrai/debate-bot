      "text": "The concern about TikTok is not merely about one platform but about **allowing foreign control of critical digital infrastructure that generates hundreds of billions in economic value**. When a Chinese company controls the dominant social media platform in the US market, it **extracts economic value that could otherwise remain in the American economy and benefit US companies, creators, and workers**. Rather than allowing this wealth extraction, banning TikTok enables US competitors or innovations to capture this market opportunity domestically."

      "text": "While some argue a ban causes economic harm, research indicates the real economic cost comes from allowing continued Chinese control. **U.S. businesses currently integrated with TikTok could experience layoffs and downsizing due to decreased engagement and sales\u2014but these losses represent a temporary transition cost rather than permanent economic damage**. More significantly, **banning TikTok prevents the ongoing extraction of $16 billion annually in ad revenue and $15 billion in small business e-commerce revenue that currently flows to Chinese ownership**, allowing these resources to be redirected to American platforms and enterprises."

      "text": "The economic argument for banning TikTok focuses on market reallocation rather than net job loss. **TikTok's demonstrated $16 billion annual ad revenue and $15 billion in small business e-commerce revenue represent genuine economic value that could shift to U.S.-based competitors like Meta or other domestic platforms**. Rather than this wealth being permanently lost, **banning TikTok redirects a massive revenue stream to American companies, keeping digital economy profits within the domestic market, benefiting American shareholders, workers, and the broader economy**."
